        <h2>Jason's First Adventure: The Day I Found My Human</h2>
        <article>
            <p><em>Published: November</em></p>
            <p>Well, well, well. Some people say Friday the 13th is unlucky. But I, Jason, know better. It’s the day I waltzed into my human’s life and turned their world upside down in the best possible way, of course. I was minding my own business in a bin in Limerick when they found me, but I wasn’t scared. No, I strutted out like the king I was meant to be. My human had no idea what they were in for!</p>
            <p>From the moment I stepped into my new home, I made sure to explore every corner. I knocked over a few cups, climbed on the furniture, and checked out the kitchen – the most important place, if you ask me. It didn’t take long for me to figure out where the food is kept, and I’ve been perfecting my “I’m starving” routine ever since.</p>
            <p>But it’s not all mischief – I have a soft side too. I love cuddling with my human when they least expect it, usually when they’re trying to read or work. That’s when I jump up and demand attention. Who could resist me, right? Life with my human is pretty sweet, and I’m just getting started. Friday the 13th? More like the luckiest day of their life.</p>
